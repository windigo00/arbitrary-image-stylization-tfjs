This demo could not have been done without the following:

* Authors of the [arbitrary style transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06830) paper.
* The Magenta repository for [arbitrary style transfer](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/arbitrary_image_stylization).
* Authors of [the MobileNet-v2 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381).
* Authors of the paper describing [neural network knowledge distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531).
* The [TensorFlow.js library](https://js.tensorflow.org).
* [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), with which I was able 
to do all necessary training using a free(!) GPU.
